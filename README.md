# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### [Dart](https://dart.dev) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://demo.realworld.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[Dart](https://github.com/dart-lang/shelf)** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[Dart](https://dart.dev/community)** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

> Describe the general architecture of your app here

# Getting started

Install the [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart).

## Running the App

### Running with the Dart SDK

You can run the example with the [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
like this:
